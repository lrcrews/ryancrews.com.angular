It's meant to be useful as an example of various patterns in an angular/typescript app, so some things may seem like overkill out of context, but at least they'll be pretty!

I do enjoy clean code.  You may notice that as you look through various files.  I believe the most important part of an app's codebase is the ability for any developer to:

1. read it, we want the codebase to be well linted and follow consistent organization of folders/files
2. understand it, we want small modular classes and methods that maintain single responsibilities
3. change it, we want test coverage that makes refactoring an easy process

## More readme coming soon!  (hooray?)
